# Fruit Ninja Unity Game
This is a simple practice unity game. It works on android. I followed a tutorial from a Udemy course called the Complete C# Masterclass but did a lot of the programming and building on my own, using the tutorial as a reference or "how its supposed to be done". I also modeled all the fruit and items on my own using blender.
